1. Get rid of all unused methods or values from score-generator3.js. In the future, try not to write always a new solution with extra lines to compenasate old mistakes, try to keep the code short. Let's talk about pipelines more in the future before adding extra lines.
2. Highlights and dynamics should always have the same X-dimension split points. So first you should calculate these general split points, then apply to both highlights and dynamics.
3. Don't ever use multirests.
4. Always align score to the left (not centered).
